# EASY ML
**easy_ml** is a machine learning library that executes on top of the **scikit-learn**.
This is a small project where you can train multiple models in a single line and get the best perfoming model.
**easy_ml** is under development and this project is open to contributions from anyone ðŸ¤— 

# Roadmap

# Sample Code
```python
from easy_ml.models import regression
reg = regression(X_train,y_train,X_train,y_test)
result = reg.result() # returns the pandas dataframe
model = reg.get_best() 
```
